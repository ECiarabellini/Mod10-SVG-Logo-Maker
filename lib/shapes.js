// make functions for all of these lines of the test code:
// const shape = new Triangle();
// shape.setColor("blue");
// expect(shape.render()).toEqual('<polygon points="150, 18 244, 182 56, 182" fill="blue" />');

//it is recommended that you place any common functionality and properties shared by the Triangle, Circle, and Square 
//   classes in a parent Shape class and use inheritance to reuse the code in the child classes

// Exports `Triangle`, `Circle`, and `Square` classes
